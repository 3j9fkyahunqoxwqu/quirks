### Code of conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Please read and
respect the [WHATWG Code of Conduct](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct).

### Pull requests

In short, change `Overview.bs` and submit your patch, with a
[good commit message](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages). Consider
reading through the [WHATWG FAQ](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ) if you are new here.

Please add your name to the Acknowledgments section in your first pull request, even for trivial
fixes. The names are sorted lexicographically.

To generate `Overview.html`, [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) can be used. (Do not
worry if using that tool is too complicated, your pull request does not need to contain the
generated HTML to be accepted.)

### Tests

Tests can be found in the `quirks-mode/` directory of
[`w3c/web-platform-tests`](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests).
